### SSD Assignment-2
**1.)** Used `bs4`, `requests`, `csv` libraries. Used class names of tags to crawl them.
- `get_text()` method is used to get data in a html tag
-  Comparison with `None` is done to check if a particluar tag exist or not. If it does not exit then I have stored `Not available` in it's place.

**2.)** Made list of 26 zeros using `[0]*26`. Counted frequency of all alphabets. If any  zero is left after processing the string then it's not panagram. 
**3.)** Extracted all names starting with Capital letter using `lambda` and then calculated sum of length strings in list returned by `lambda` 
**4.)** I have printed a particular binary number(divisible by 5) only once even if it appears multiple times in input string
